<h2>Movement Techniques</h2>
    <p>Fencers use various movement techniques to navigate the piste and outmaneuver their opponents. 
        The basic movements include advancing, retreating, and shuffling, which involve transferring weight and moving the feet in a specific way to maintain balance and generate power. 
        Fencers also use lunging, a fundamental movement that involves extending the front leg and transferring weight onto it to attack or cover distance. 
        Additionally, fencers may use recovery techniques, such as replacing or re-advancing, to regain their guard position and prepare for the next action.</p>
<h2>Defensive Techniques</h2>
    <p>Fencers use various defensive techniques to counter their opponents' attacks, including parrying, which involves deflecting the opponent's blade with one's own. 
        There are several types of parries, including prime, seconde, tierce, quarte, and quinte, each covering a specific area of the body. Fencers may also use other defensive techniques, such as yielding or retreating, to create distance and avoid an opponent's attack. 
        Effective defensive techniques require good footwork, timing, and blade control, allowing fencers to neutralize their opponents' attacks and create counterattacking opportunities.</p>
<h2>Sparring Basics</h2>
    <p>Fencing sparring, also known as "bouting," is a controlled combat situation where two fencers engage in a simulated fight, testing their skills and strategies against each other. 
        To begin a bout, fencers salute each other and the referee, then assume the en garde position, ready to start on command. 
        During the bout, fencers exchange attacks, parries, and ripostes, with the goal of scoring valid points against their opponent. 
        Effective sparring requires a combination of technical skill, tactical awareness, and physical conditioning, as well as the ability to adapt to different opponents and situations.</p>
